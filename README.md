# AllYoloModels
## Short Introduction
Hello everyone! 😊

My name is Catargiu Constantin and I am studying PhD at Gheorghe Asachi University in Iasi, Romania. During my work research I've started to read and learn about YOLO(You Only Look Once) models which can be used for Object Detection, Object  Tracking, Image Classification and Image Segmentation and also to use them in some object detection applications. Because there are many versions of the YOLO model (currently the latest one is YoloV9) is somehow hard to decide which one fits best for a certaion application, so I've tested each model starting with version 5 to version 9. Testing means that I performed:

  - 📊 Evaluation on Test and Valid data.
  
  - 🏋️‍♂️ Training on custom dataset.
  
  - 🧠 Inference on videos files and images.

During my experiments, I gained experience with the scripts provided in the orignal repositorys by the authors of the models, and I want to share this with you. Due to the fact that the models are developed by different scientists, their  usage differ and in this repo I made same .sh file in which facilitate the usage of train, evaluation and inference scripts in just one line of code for every model that you want to use 😊

## Features

- ⬇️ Clone/Reclone and prepare the setup for which model you want in just a line of code using **DownloadModel.sh**.
- 🔧 **YoloModelsEval.sh**, **YoloModelsInference.sh** and **YoloModelsTrain.sh** offer the possibility to perform training, inference, or evaluation tasks in just a line of code using a selected model.
- 📈  Experimental results that were obtained during my experiments using all the models mentioned here.

  <summary>Project overview</summary>
After this repository is cloned the structure of the project will look like in the images bellow with the mention that the **YoloModels** directory is empty because no model is cloned there.

## Quick start

<details>
    <summary>Give permission for .sh scripts on Linux</summary>

  ```bash
  chmod +X DownloadModel.sh
  chmod +X YoloModelsEval.sh
  chmod +X YoloModelsInference.sh
  chmod +X YoloModelsTrain.sh

  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Clone specific YOLO model</summary>
  
  To clone a specifi yolo model **DownloadModel.sh** is used that requires on parameter from the list (yolov5, yolov6, yolov7, yolov8, yolov9).
  
  ```bash
  ./DownloadModel.sh yolov5
  ```

Notice that first you clone the model, requirements.txt for it will be also installed.
After the model is cloned it will appear in **YoloModels** directory. If the model is already there and the script is executed and message will appear and ask if we want to reclone or no.

<details>
  <summary>Dowmload COCO dataset</summary>

To download COCO dataset you can use **Utility-->DatasetDownloadScripts-->get_coco.sh**.
The dataset will be downloaded in **Utility-->COCOdatasets**.

Notice that the labels for testing set are not available, or at least I didn't found them. another observation will be that for YoloV6 we need to use boundig box format labels no polygon format labels for the evaluation task.
